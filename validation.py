# validate input good, bad, ugly!!!

# ℹ️ info: A while loop is a repeating structure. It keeps running as long as a condition is true.
# ⚠️ warning: In this example, the loop continues until the user enters a name that is not empty.
# 💡tip: This is called input validation because we are checking that the input is acceptable before moving on.
name = ""
while not name:
    name = input("Please enter your name:  ").strip()
    # ℹ️ info: Input is cleaned with .strip() before validation so extra spaces do not count as a value.
    # 💡tip: We can also format the first letter of the name with .capitalize() to make it look cleaner.
    name = name.capitalize()
print(f"Hello, {name}")

# ℹ️ info: A try/except block helps us catch errors without crashing the whole program.
# ⚠️ warning: If the user enters a non-number, Python raises a ValueError when we try to convert it to an int.
# 💡tip: The except block gives us a friendly message and keeps the program under control.
try:
    age = -1
    # ℹ️ info: This while loop validates the age range. We keep asking until the age is between 0 and 100.
    # ⚠️ warning: If the user enters an invalid value, the condition is still true and the loop repeats.
    while age < 0 or age > 100:
        age = int(input("How old are you?  "))
